Hi there! 

This is Wen, Xiang, and Yang. We are trying to develop a chatbot to deliver **mental health first aid service** for those in need, especially those currently going through tough times due to COVID-19 pandemic.

## Aim

The MHFA chatbot is not used for conducting professional psychological consultation, but to fulfil the function of MHFA, which includes:

- **A**pproach the person, assess and assist with any crisis
- **L**isten and communicate non-judgementally
- **G**ive support and information
- **E**ncourage the person to get appropriate professional help
- **E**ncourage other supports

-   MHFA website: [https://mhfa.com.au](https://mhfa.com.au/)

These five aspects were recognized as the MHFA action plan “ALGEE”. The main aim of the ALGEE is to provide initial help and direct those in mental health crisis to seek appropriate professional help. As current research suggests that it’s not feasible for artificial intelligence to conduct the same quality psychological consultation yet, using an NLP-based algorithm to deliver MHFA service might be the advanced move in e-healthcare that is feasible and valuable.

## Target user

MHFA chatbot is ***not targeting those who already been diagnosed with mental health disease***, as what diagnosed patients need is professional intervention, such as cognitive behavior therapy conducted by professional and licensed psychologists.

**The target population of MHFA chatbot:**

 - Those undergoing a mental health crisis while not being aware of it
  
 - Those who are unwilling to seek professional help due to limited
   mental health literacy

MHFA chatbot can be promoted to the general population as a potential screening tool, maximizing the coverage to those in need.

## Key feature

 1. emotion detection through voice message and text message
 2. reply correlating MHFA message to users according to their emotional status
 3. chat with users in 2 different tone: neutral and caring
